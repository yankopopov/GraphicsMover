Validation Sampler
------------------
SSK3 comes with a 'validation sampler' app here: ~/validation/

> This app is meant to be run in the simulator.
> It is designed to validate SSK3 features *AND* to provide many working examples for you.

To run the sampler, do the following:

1. Copy the ssk folder (and all its contents) into ~/validation/
2. Open main.lua in the *SIMULATOR*.  This will display a menu of samples you can run.
3. Click on any sample button to run that sample.
4. Re-load simulator (CTRL+R or CMD+R) to see the menu again.

(Although it will work, the sampler is not designed to run easily on a device.  i.e. You'll need to quit the app to run a new sample.)



Sample Code
-----------
The code for each example/test in the validation can be found in the folder: ~/validation/tests/



What is "ssk3j.bat"?
--------------------
I work (primarily on Windows).  To make my life easier, I do not copy ssk3 to my work folders.  I use a junction.

Junctions are (basically) the windows equivalent of a symbolic link.

You may ignore this file, or you may make your own equivalent on Windows or OS X systems.
